        >
        is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed and published by independent
        developer Team Cherry. In the game, the player controls the Knight, a
        nameless insectoid warrior, who explores Hallownest, a fallen kingdom
        plagued by a supernatural disease, known as the infection. The game is
        set in diverse subterranean locations, featuring friendly and hostile
        insectoid characters and numerous bosses. Players have the opportunity
        to unlock new abilities as they explore each location, along with pieces
        of lore and flavour text that are spread throughout the kingdom.

        The concept behind Hollow Knight was conceived in 2013 in the Ludum Dare
        game jam. Team Cherry wanted to create a game inspired by older
        platformers that replicated the explorational aspects of its influences.
        Inspirations for the game include Faxanadu, Metroid, Zelda II: The
        Adventure of Link, Angel's Egg, and Mega Man X. Development was
        partially funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that raised
        over A$57,000 by the end of 2014. It was released for Windows, Linux,
        and macOS, in early 2017 and for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and
        Xbox One in 2018. After release, Team Cherry supported the game with
        four free expansions.
