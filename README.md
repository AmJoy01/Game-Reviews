## Description

This is a video game reviews website describing games I played over the Summer of 2023.

## Technologies Used

I made this site using HTML/CSS to practice formatting and multipage hopping. HTML files are connected using an anchor tag and then user is able to click back to home.

## Challenges I faced

Styling. Just need more practice on what looks appealing and user-friendly.
