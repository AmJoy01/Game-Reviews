        In the game, the player takes the role of an amorphous creature called
        the Prisoner. As the Prisoner, the player must fight their way out of a
        diseased island in order to slay the island's King. The player gains
        weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the
        procedurally-generated levels, using them to fight various mutated
        creatures. Dead Cells features a permadeath system, causing the player
        to lose all items and other currencies upon dying.
