          The story follows Lily, the last surviving priestess in a land
          devastated by an endless and oppressive rain that drives living things
          demented and transforms them into undead while granting immortality.
          Awakening in a church with no recollection of recent events, Lily
          turns to exploring beyond the safety of the sanctuary to find the
          source of the rain. Along the way, Lily can summon the spirits of
          purified undead to protect her.
